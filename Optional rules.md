Depending on the tone of your game, you may choose not to use Snake Eyes and Box
Cars. For instance, it is not a part of the original City of Mist rules. You may also rule that,
when modifiers make it so you fail a roll in spite of having Box Cars or succeed in spite of
having Snake Eyes, the category of the roll is automatically upgraded/downgraded by one
increment. This is not the default rule.
