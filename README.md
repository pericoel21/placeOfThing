This system is an adaptation of Son Of Oak's *City of Mist.*
## About
This repository is a series of notes created in markdown format and intended to be used with Obsidian. The rules can be easily navigated within GitHub, but some of the Obsidian features truly make this repository a great resource for GMing the game.

Some other features I added:
- A Player Character creation section.
- Cleanup of the phrasing of the rules to make them more easily consulted.
- Tags for each note (a note is basically a chapter of the rules).
- Structure of Theme Sheets, Theme Kits, Backgrounds, Moves, Threats... In a way that a database can be created.

## Roadmap
I want to create a `.canvas` file to have a GM screen with all the relevant info in one place.
I still didn't get to create all the Threats, and some notes are not complete or simply pasted from the book.
