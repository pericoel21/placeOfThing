> Short and sturdy, dwarves dwell underground, some of them so deep that they never even see the surface. Given their powerful metabolism and immune systems, some can get rather embarrassed about their photosensitivity. Dwarven society is stratified and materialist, believing in strict social order and diligent perfectionism usually expressed through the grandiosity of their craftsmanship.
