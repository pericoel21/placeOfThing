> Though magic flows through everything, elves have the strongest inherent connection to it. They lead long lives that allow them to accrue much patience and wisdom, but can also calcify their thinking and make them slow to adjust. Blessed with sharp senses and graceful agility, they can be physically fragile, which many compensate for by using ancient techniques or inherent sorcery talents.
