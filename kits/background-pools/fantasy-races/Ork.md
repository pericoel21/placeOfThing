> A nomadic people, often maligned, orks are physically powerful but lacking in social skills, including with their own kind. Instead of complex civilisations, they form loose confederations of individuals tied together by mutual interest. These need not even be other orks. Such groups often seek greatness in a particular field and will be very loyal internally, but lack interest in wider-reaching social constructs.
