> You lived in a cloistered acolyte of a monastery, perhaps urban, perhaps rural, but deliberately insular from outside influence. Perhaps you grew up here, a third son or second daughter, perhaps you took up residence in this place for some years in order to fully dedicate yourself to the study of theology and a good, ascetic life. This has left your worldview limited, but also much deeper than the understanding that most people will ever gain for the wonders of reality.
