> You performed, perhaps in large shows, perhaps on the side of the road, and made a living by taking people’s minds off the day-to-day. Creating levity is something that comes easily, though sometimes you may yearn for some serious drama that will have people in tears of catharsis. Whichever craft you ply your artistry in, there is a bond that connects you to other entertainers, a solidarity of people who understand each other, and are distrusted as often as they are celebrated.
