> Your blood is blue, descended from a long line of venerable ancestors with long names and even longer titles. Though born into great wealth and privilege, imbued by virtue of your blood with authority and power over others, this comes with a great responsibility to guide those of a lesser station to you, be able to make the right decisions for them, and always act with impeccable honour and integrity. If nothing else, you have seen the sorts of people who ignore these sacred duties up close.
