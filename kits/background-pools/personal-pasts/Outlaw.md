> You have lived a life in the shadow of the law, on the fringes of polite society. Maybe you were forced into it to make a living at all, maybe you felt the allure of wealth easily acquired. You know how to skirt the rules and systems that the powers that be keep codified, or maybe you have thus far avoided them altogether by being in places where they factually hold little sway. It’s not an easy life, and certainly a dangerous one, but the rewards can be great.
