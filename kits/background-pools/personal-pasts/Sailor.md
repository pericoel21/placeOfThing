> You are at home on the seas at least as much as you are on the land. When you must travel by boat, your skillset makes it so you can usually book passage in exchange for labour, and even when you are far from the water your knowledge of winds and navigation can be a great boon. Maybe you love the sea, fickle though it is, or maybe you just do not fear it, or maybe the reason you are not on land is because you have learned to be terrified. Whatever your reasons, you are a daring soul, and your life has always been full of adventure.
