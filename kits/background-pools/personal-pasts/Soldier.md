> You have led a life of violence, but also one of loyalty and camaraderie. Even if you have never seen battle, and you probably have, your endurance, discipline, and weapon training make you a force to be reckoned with. Understanding strategy and tactics can bring the advantage that tips the scales of any conflict. Any adventurer can have had brushes with war, but you are an expert, comfortable in situations most people would lose their cool in.
