> You have seen the world, and the world has seen you. There are as many lands you have seen as lands you haven’t, and your interest in distant places means you know quite a bit even of the ones you have never set foot in. The wilderness does not daunt you, and neither do strange customs or languages. Many treat you with curiosity, though many more treat you with suspicion, and a rolling stone rarely sets down roots or something, it doesn’t translate well into the local dialect.
