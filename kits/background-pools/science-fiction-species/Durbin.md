> Hulking ursine brokers with slick blue fur and two pairs of eyes, the Durbin are known across the galaxy as shrewd but honest merchants. Physically formidable and easy-going, they are seldom fazed and not easily threatened, especially not by would-be pirates targeting their gargantuan interstellar vessels. Their government, a complex system of artisan guilds and labour unions, is keen to be in good standing with other species, so while everyone tends to trust them, they also know not to rely on them too much.
