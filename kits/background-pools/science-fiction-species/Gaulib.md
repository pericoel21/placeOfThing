> No matter how sophisticated your defences, the Gaulib will find a way to penetrate them. They are exceptional warriors precisely because they are flexible in both body and mind, and have developed weapons and combat styles that work well with their molluscoid lack of firmness. Their social groups are led by elected chiefs which act as sole authority in combat, but tend to leave much to open votes. Each Gaulib has as many votes as there are tentacles on their hand, so careless ones have less of a say, but still get to learn because all their appendages eventually grow back.
