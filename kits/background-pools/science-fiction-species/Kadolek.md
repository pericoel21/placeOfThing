> Though some might call them zealots, these avian proselytisers chirp the songs of many religions, worldviews, and ideologies. For millennia they have dedicated their lives to understanding the theologies of all species in order to syncretise and incorporate them into their total-universalist meta-religion. Some among them become radical true believers, to the exclusion of their original faith, but the Kadolek do not consider them wayward, but guideposts for just how far belief can go.
