What your Background represents depends on your particular game. It might be your species, your culture, or some other inalienable distinction of the way you grew up. It may even be a combination of things, and that combination may be different for various characters in the same game. It is composed of 4 Tags, one of which is a permanent Story Tag, known as your Background Tag, that is not burned when invoked.
This Story tag is a summation of your character’s Background, like Brave Goblin, Deceitful
Marshlander, or Gregarious Scholar. Because this tag is often quite broad, you may only
invoke it once per session.

The other three are Story Tags that act similarly to the tags in your Loadout, except they are drawn from a different pool of possible tags. Much like you can put anything that is
reasonably available during Downtime into your Loadout, you can have anything that is
reasonably encompassed by your Background in your Background Loadout. Just like tags in your regular Loadout, when you invoke one, it is burned. When you gain one, you can come up with a new one (or choose to regain the one you burned earlier). It is recommended that you
keep a list of potential tags handy somewhere, just to help you come up with them on the
spot. The size of that pool is not actually important to game balance, as the power of this
mechanic is regulated differently.
It is nonetheless important to know what your species or upbringing entails, so you
can know when it is reasonable to invoke it.
In certain cases, having a pool for sample tags actually does matter. For example, in
one setting, dwarves have darkvision. This is written down in a catalogue of racial features
the GM has prepared for this game. It is important that everyone is on the same page about that. Dwarf characters have the Background Tag Dwarf, and one of the power tags in their
pool is Darkvision.
A player could use both Dwarf and Darkvision in the same roll, getting +2 to that roll
but both utilising the one time they can invoke their Background Tag and burning one of the
Story Tags from their Background Loadout. Narratively they still have darkvision after that, but
it won’t be able to impact the story as much again (unless they regain it back into the
Background Loadout).
That player might also decide that their particular dwarf does not have very good
darkvision in spite of being a dwarf, in which case it would no longer be reasonable to put it
in the Background Loadout.
You may fill one of your Background Loadout slots every time your Background Tag is
used against you, in which case it acts like a Weakness Tag would. This means that choosing
a background that will often disadvantage you will give you a lot more Story Tags as well,
while choosing one that will rarely bite you in the arse also gives you fewer advantages.
If your entire party has the same Background Tag and you would like to use this space
to distinguish them otherwise, or if you have made the mistake of casting humans as the
“default” race instead of giving them a distinct identity and place in the world, remember that
your Background Tag could also be Farmer, or Noble, or Mercenary. The Background
Loadout Story Tags could then be enduring character traits like Clever, Stubborn, or
Perceptive, or skills you learned like Predict Weather, Court Etiquette, or Provisions.
This is of course also true if your Background Tag is your species, and you’d prefer to
keep that in the background (haha) in favour of your actual Background. And even if your
Background Tag is more representative of your upbringing, there is no reason why a boring
human shouldn’t, through some fluke or mutation, have the power of Darkvision.
You can also expound on elements of your Background by representing them in
themes. If being a dwarf is important to you, various themes can represent that and/or
aspects of it.
​
Something that is more easily recovered is your Loadout, which holds 4 Story Tags.
How that works is covered in the Downtime Move. Your Loadout represents things you have
prepared for the specific task you are undertaking right now. They allow for a degree of
flexibility, so you can lean further into your strengths or make up for some of your
shortcomings. Things like Reflex Booster, Healing Potion, Guard Captain’s Secret, Goons
on Call, Heat Ammo, and Meditative Focus can come in handy depending on the situation.
All of your 4 Loadout tags are burned when you invoke them.
​
Filling your Loadout is a great way to do on shopping trips, but of course they do not
need to represent equipment. The Loadout is also a great place to “test out” new Power Tags
that you eventually want to add to your Themes on a permanent basis.
