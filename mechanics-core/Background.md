> [!important] Background in a nutshell
> Composed of 4 tags:
> - The **Background Tag:** Use it **once per session.**
> - Three Tags for your **Background Loadout.** Function as the regular [[Loadout]].

> [!tip] Backgrounds depend on settings
> What your Background represents depends on your particular game. It might be your species, your culture, or some other distinction of the way you grew up.

> [!info] Background VS Themes
> Although a Background seems to cover the profession, species or past of a character, elements of the Background can be expanded by representing them in themes. If being a dwarf is important to you, various themes can represent that and/or aspects of it.
## The Background Tag
The Background Tag works as a title of one PC's Background and is personalized to them.
- Functions as a [[Story Tags|Story Tag]].
- It is not burned when used.
- Can only be invoked once per session.
- It can otherwise be invoked against the character.
	- This does not count against the limit of one time per session that the Background Tag has.
	- It works like a Weakness Tag.
	- Accepting this negative use refills one Tag in the Background Loadout.

> [!example] Personalizing the Background Tag
> The Background Tag is a summation of a character’s Background, like Brave Goblin, Deceitful Marshlander, or Gregarious Scholar.

> [!tip] Background Tag as a Weakness Tag
>  A Background Tag which can be easily invoked as a Weakness will often disadvantage the PC, but it will also refill the Background Loadout much more easily. 
## The Background Loadout
The Background Loadout is composed by three Story Tags. They act similarly to the tags in your [[Loadout]].
### Using Background Loadout Tags
- Background Loadout Tags are considered Story Tags.
- Once invoked, these Tags are burnt.
### Recovering Background Tags
- Recovered during [[Downtime]].
- One is recovered if the player accepts the use of the Background Tag as a Weakness Tag.
- Any reasonable Tag can be added to the Background Loadout.
- A pool of possible Tags is presented in each Background.

> [!tip] Consensus about the Background in the setting
> It is important to know what your species or upbringing entails, so you can know what Tags can be created, and when it is reasonable to invoke them.

> [!tip] Background Loadout vs regular Loadout
> The Loadout represents things a character have prepared for the specific task they are undertaking right now. This Tags are very flexible, and easier to recover.

> [!example] Examples:
> A player could use both Dwarf and Darkvision in the same roll, getting +2 to that roll. This is one time they can invoke their Background Tag for that session. It also burns one of the Story Tags from their Background Loadout.
> Narratively they still have darkvision after that, but it won’t be able to impact the story as much again (unless they regain it back into the Background Loadout).
> 
> That player might also decide that their particular dwarf does not have very good darkvision in spite of being a dwarf, in which case it would no longer be reasonable to put it in the Background Loadout.
