> [!important] Character creation in a nutshell
> To create a character the player must have 3 themes and a background.
> 

> [!note] For the Background:
> 1. Select one of the Backgrounds compiled by the GM.
> 2. Create a Background Tag that represents the PC's relation to that background.
> 3. Select 4 Tags from the pool of Background Tags.
> 4. Select a Weakness Tags from the background.

> [!note] For each Theme:
> 1. Pick a Theme Sheet from the list of Theme Sheets.
> 2. Theme Sheet Flavours can be changed to make more sense.
> 3. Answer the question A. The answer is the first Power Tag, and the name of the Theme.
> 4. Answer 2 other questions, resulting in 2 more Power Tags.
> 5. Answer one of the questions in the Weakness Tag section, creating the Weakness Tag of that Theme.
> 6. Repeat 3 times (a starting PC has 3 Themes).
> 7. (Optional). Pick your most important Theme:
> - Add an extra Power Tag (by answering a Power Tag question).
> - Add an extra Weakness Tag (by answering a Weakness Tag question).

> [!info] Broad Tags
>  A Broad Tag is a Power Tag so versatile it could be used in almost any situation.
>  It is only available as a single Power Tag in just one of the PC's Themes.
>  If a Power Tag seems too broad, the GM might still let the PC keep it if some limitations are created.
