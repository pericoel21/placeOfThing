- Start with 3 themes and have up to 4
- Theme Sheet flavours can be changed to make more sense
- To fill out a Theme Sheet, jot the answer to the first question on it on your character
sheet. This is your first Power Tag, and it doubles as the name for your Theme. Answer two more questions of your choice to make two additional Power Tags. Now answer one of the Weakness Tag questions.

Any Theme Flavour can feature any kind of Aspect, and if it gets resolved, it can
change to any other kind. More information on their interplay can be found in the Make Some
Progress Cinematic Move.
Also available in only one of your Themes is a Broad Tag. This is a Power Tag so
versatile it could be used in almost any situation, like Wizard’s Grimoire and Universal
Omnitool. Notice the “almost” in that sentence. Power Tags that can pretty much always be
invoked, such as Lucky or Jack of All Trades should never be allowed. If a Power Tag seems
too broad to the GM, you may still be able to keep it if you talk about some limitations. Lucky
Gambler and Warmage’s Grimoire are specific enough to not be Broad Tags any more,
provided the GM has a handle on Power Tag restrictions. Diving away from a bullet is not
“gambling,” and just because “love is war” doesn’t mean you’ll find a love spell in that book. A
Broad Tag that is more likely to result in your character doing interesting things in the fiction
will probably sway your GM more than one that just makes you “better” at a broad number of
things.
