The purpose of making a GM Move is so a piece of fiction has mechanical consequences.
> [!example]
> Inflicting a Status of 1 or 6 are both Hard Moves, as are “making the macguffin fall through a sewer grate” and “annihilating an entire city in nuclear hellfire.”

## Soft Move
**The GM uses a Soft Move when a player rolls a 7-9,** or any time tension is stalling around the table.
- They tend not to have severe mechanical consequences.
- They still complicate things in the fiction.
- Typically used to telegraph a dangerous situation that is inbound.

The world is getting ready to act, but the players still have time to prepare themselves and do something about the situation before it goes poorly for them.

If they choose not to, that’s their problem, because it automatically gives you licence to go one step further.
> [!example] The cave rumbles, the berserker twirls her axe, or the constable yells “Stop!”
## Hard Move
**The GM uses a Hard Move when a player rolls a 6 or less.**
Hard Moves allows the GM to:
- Burn [[Themes]].
- Dish out [[Statuses]].
	- PCs might be able to [[Endure]].
- Make definitive calls on how any aspect of a situation plays out.
- Determine that a situation has failed.

> [!example] Examples:
> - The stalactite falls -> The characters take a Status.
> - The berserker enters a mighty rage -> The NPC gains a beneficial Status.
> - The constable summons a spectral barrier. The exit is blocked. -> Definitive call on a situation.
> - The prisoner escapes -> Failed situation.

> [!danger] Make sure the Hard Movemakes sense in the context of the story. 

> [!example] Making sense of the situation:
>  Getting shot with a plasma rifle might melt your Duraweave Plating, but it won’t make your Bounty Hunter Lounge Access disappear.

### On burning Tags
Burning Power tags forces PCs to spend [[Downtime]] recovering. Hinders them without the need to stick them with dozens of statuses.

> [!example] Examples of burned Tags:
>  - The Magic Pickaxe is damaged. 
>  - Someone pulls a muscle and thus can’t Lift Heavy Things.
>  - Their Underworld Fence considers them too hot to do business with right now.

## Using GM moves
The **mechanics of GM Moves need not stand in the way** when it comes to deciding what happens in the fiction:
- **Nothing needs to explicitly be a Hard or Soft Move.**
- Soft and Hard moves are just game mechanics to **give structure** to the conversation around the table.
- **Interesting things are not limited** to happening only when the characters are **failing** their checks.

> [!tip] How to think about GM moves
>  it might help to think of them not so much as *failing.*
>  Rather, a better definition is *progressing the story into an unfortunate direction, away from the goal of the characters.*”
### Hard vs Soft moves
> [!example] Consider this scene:
> The characters are in a noodle shop, and suddenly the Yakuza show up with submachine guns and start unloading into the establishment.

If the GM has a Hard Move because someone just rolled a 6 or less, PCs should [[Endure]] the consequences of the fusillade.

In the other hand, this could be a Soft Move, which a GM can do any time to nudge the story somewhere. The GM now announces the shooting just started, but asks each PC how they want to react to it. Whatever they choose will be a [[Risk]].

If they roll a 6 or less there, they get to [[Endure]] against your Hard Move. If not, they get to do whatever they were trying to do, even if that thing requires an additional roll (like returning fire as a [[Fight]] Move).

Narratively, the exact same thing has happened: a bunch of yakuza thugs opened fire
on the crew.
- Doing it as a **Soft Move** gave the characters an **extra Player Move** to insulate themselves from taking Statuses, and even act on top of that.
- The **Hard Move,** justified by a previous roll, made the situation into a **more immediate danger.**
### Definition of severity based on fiction
What makes a Soft Move soft and a Hard Move hard depends on the kind of story you are telling.
> [!example] Examples:
> In a soapy drama about an remarkably diverse ensemble cast of 19th century aristocrats, a slew of insults might be a Hard Move that inflicts quite a devastating Status to a character’s morale and reputation.
> 
> In a fight between tough blokes who spit on the ground, being called a piss-drinking shitcunt dogfucker might be just a Soft Move to telegraph that the gentleman who just summoned that clever epithet entirely from the fabric of his sheer intellect is about to “bash your fuckin’ ‘ead in.”
> 
> Regular human people usually die when a missile explodes in their face, making it a Hard Move. But to a spaceship, that one explosion tanked by its kinetic shields may be a Soft Move to announce the rest of the swarm of missiles following hot on its trail.
