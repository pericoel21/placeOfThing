In classic RPG terms, hazards are the monsters and bandit thugs, but that would be an oversimplification of what they can be. Interesting environments, natural phenomena, and even quests that saddle you with unique dangers can be Hazards.

What defines them is that they can be used to flavour GM Moves against the players.

> [!note] A GM could run a game without ever assembling a single Hazard Card, making up relevant moves on the fly.
## Hazard Cards​
Hazard Cards are lists containing four major sections:
### Spectrums
Spectrums describe **ways in which dangers can be overcome.** This does not include all the possible ways, only the most obvious ones.

The most common Spectrum **is reducing the “health”** of the Hazard in question. Some Hazards, like a mountain range you need to traverse, have no health you can overcome, but the act of traversing it is its equivalent to that.

Some Hazards may also have **locked Spectrums,** describing ways in which they specifically **cannot be overcome.**
### Custom Moves
Including pre-established Story Tags and Statuses, the descriptions of Spectrums and what they do, and ways of interfacing with various other systems, or make the rules work differently to how they usually do.

Though they offer a lot of potential, a Hazard can be perfectly hazardous without having any Custom Moves.
### Hard Moves
[[Hard Moves]] are all the heavy-hitting ways in which Hazards can ruin your players’ day. Most prominently this is giving [[Statuses]] to characters, but it could also include major complications like bringing new Hazards into the game or otherwise limiting the options of the player characters.
### Soft Moves
Soft Moves are mostly for fluff (which is extremely important), and include a lot of
narrative and roleplaying cues with which to depict this Hazard and make it feel like whatever it represents in the fiction.

They are perfect for telegraphing to the players that something bad is about to happen for them soon, and they better get ready for it.

> [!example] Examples:
> The automatic laser cannon arming itself with a hiss, the combat arcanist mumbling incantations as he collects dark energy, or the crack lawyercharming the Jury because she expects to deliver a very compelling argument soon. 
​
## Creating & balancing Hazards
- Consider the severity of Statuses a Hazard can dish out.
- Feel free to adjust numbers on the fly.
- Hazards get to “act” as GM moves, which you get more of the more players there are.
- Soaking Potential as a metric of difficulty:
	- Having more Spectrums means that PCs need to create more Statuses in order to overcome a Hazard.
	- This is the closest homology to Action Economy when it comes to balancing Hazards.
- Four dials to modify in a hazard:
	- [[Statuses]]: Remember that only the greatest positive and the greatest negative ones are taken into account.
	- [[Story Tags]]: Remember that any number of them are stacked on top of the statuses.
	- [[Status|Status Filter]]: Reduces some incoming statuses by a set number.

> [!important] A +/- 1 to any roll is significant. don’t bloat your Hazard Cards with tags, mechanics, and statuses you will definitely forget in the heat of the moment.

### The four dials
You could represent the same element of the fiction in any number of different ways. A force field that protects a Hazard could be:
- A Status if you want to emphasise how it changes the strategic situation.
- A Story Tag if it’s one relevant factor out of several.
- Armour if it just cushions the Hazard against damage.
- Active Defence if it sends force bolts at anyone coming near it.

It could even be represented through several of these mechanics at the same time, though this is generally unnecessary and unbalanced. Instead, try to use these mechanics to represent different and perhaps related things, like giving the Hazard force-field-2 and a Shield Booster Pack on their belt.
#### Status
Statuses to represent particularly impactful things about the Hazard:
> [!example] Examples:
> - Temporary effects (raging-T3)
> - Social status (surrounded-by-friends-T2)
> - Skill (blademaster-T4)
> - Strategic positioning (the-high-ground-5)

Statuses can be modified by your players, but some are stickier than others.
>[!danger] Remember:
>Only the most important positive and the most important negative Status count for any given roll, so they can be very impactful.
>
>But giving your Hazards a lot of Statuses, especially when those things could also be represented situationally, is usually a waste of time.
#### Story Tags
Not every fact about your Hazard needs to be a Story Tag, only the most important ones.
> [!danger] Remember:
> Story Tags stack, not just with each other but also with Statuses. Every Story Tag “only” modifies a roll by 1, but that can add up very quickly.

> [!example]
> A Hazard may be slippery, quick, and have sharp teeth, and all of those could come to bear on the same roll.
#### Status Filter
Status Filter (Armour) reduces certain types of incoming Statuses by a certain number.

The key difference to Statuses is that Armour reduces a Status as it is dealt. It has no mechanical effect on the roll to inflict that Status. This is important because a failed roll prompts a Hard Move, and sometimes you may just want a nut that’s tough to crack but doesn’t massively endanger the players as a result.

The most classic use for this is to represent size, be that because this is just one big laser lizard or a whole squad of space pirates the players are trying to affect at once.
It could also represent the fact that someone has a truly untouchable reputation or actual literal armour made of steel, tempered glass, or gingerbread.
#### Active Defense​
Active Defense is a type of Custom Move. It requires a [[Risk]] or [[Endure]] move before any attempt at a particular interaction with the Hazard.

Whatever happens comes to pass before any attempt at that interaction is made, and they are considered chained events, so players cannot use the same Power Tags to handle them.

> [!example] Examples:
> Needing to penetrate the security node’s toothy firewall.
> The whirling cloak of frost surrounding a cryomancer.
> Entering an auto-turret’s effective firing range.
> The need to expose yourself to the jeers of the crowd as you try to make your way to the podium to speak against your opponent are all examples of this.
