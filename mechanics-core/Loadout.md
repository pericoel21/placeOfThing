4 story tags
burned when used
recover in downtime

They allow for a degree of flexibility, so you can lean further into your strengths or make up for some of your shortcomings. Things like Reflex Booster, Healing Potion, Guard Captain’s Secret, Goons on Call, Heat Ammo, and Meditative Focus can come in handy depending on the situation. All of your 4 Loadout tags are burned when you invoke them. Filling your Loadout is a great way to do on shopping trips, but of course they do not need to represent equipment. The Loadout is also a great place to “test out” new Power Tags that you eventually want to add to your Themes on a permanent basis.
