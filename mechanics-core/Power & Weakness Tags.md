Power and Weakness Tags are the main defining factors both in [[Themes|Themes]] and in [[Background|Backgrounds]].
## Creating Power Tags
A player creates Tags if they are creating or upgrading a [[Themes|Theme]]. [[Background|Backgrounds]] are pre-made packages of Tags.

To create the Tags contained in a Theme, just answer the questions on the Theme Sheet.
- A question in the Power Tag section results in a Power Tag.
- A question in the Weakness Tag section results in a Weakness Tag.
- When creating a Theme, **at least three Power Tags and one Weakness Tag** must be answered.
- Every Theme **must have the A question answered** for the Power Tag Section, and that answer doubles as the **name of this Theme.**
- The eventual limit of Tags in a Theme is 6.
- A Theme might have **an additional Power Tag if it also has an additional Weakness Tag.**
	- During **Character Creation, only one Theme** can have this extra Tags
	- Progress?
	- This increases the limit of Tags in this Theme to 7.
- A **Broad Tag** is one **incredibly versatile Power Tag that can be applied to many situations.**
	- A character might only have 1.
	- Progress? Creation?
