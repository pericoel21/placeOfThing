## Rolling dice
- The only roll in this system is `2d6 + Power.`
- The Power is gained by acting in accordance to Power Tags.
- The GM has the final decision when deciding if a Tag is applicable.
- The Power given by the Tags is consulted in the Dots Table.
### Dot bar
This relationship between Power and Tags is used for multiple things in the setting.

| Power | 1   | 2    | 3       | 4           | 5                  | 6   |
| ----- | --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --- |
| Tags  | 1   | 2, 3 | 4, 5, 6 | 7, 8, 9, 10 | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 | 16  |

### Outcome
Depending on the move, the meaning of a result can vary, but generally a basic pattern is followed:

| Result     | Name        | Outcome for the PC                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Double 1s  | Snake Eyes  | **Catastrophic failure.**<br>The GM does a **particularly severe [[Hard Move]].**                                                                      |
| 6 or less  | No, and...  | **You do not achieve the objective.**<br>The GM makes a **[[Hard Move]]** against you.                                                                 |
| 7 to 9     | Yes, but... | You **achieve the objective...**<br>...but it **doesnâ€™t quite go your way.**<br>The GM makes a **[[Soft Move]]** against you.                          |
| 10 or more | Yes!        | You achieve what you set out to do.                                                                                                                    |
| Double 6s  | Critical    | You **succeed to a high degree** and with great style.                                                                                                 |
