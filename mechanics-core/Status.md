> [!info] Statuses are more than just a health bar. They can represent any kind of condition, and are not only constrained to characters.
## Tracking statuses
You track different Statuses at the same time, and count them together when they are similar enough to be essentially the same.
### Dot bar
Statuses are tracked in a Dot Bar:

| Power | 1   | 2    | 3       | 4           | 5                  | 6   |
| ----- | --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --- |
| Dots  | 1   | 2, 3 | 4, 5, 6 | 7, 8, 9, 10 | 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 | 16  |
- When you take a Status, add or remove Dots equal to its Power.
- Whether you add or remove Dots depends on the intent of whoever is giving you the Status (or taking it away).
### Tier
A Status can have a Tier from T1 to T6 depending on its severity.
- T5 puts a PC out of commission and in the hands of the GM.
- T6 changes them in a way that means they are out of the game.

> [!example] Putting a character out of commision
> A T6 status often means a PC is killed, but depending on the game they might also have been shamed into becoming a social pariah or just give up trying to fix everything and retire to the Kerguelen Islands.
## Effect on the rolls
Whenever you roll dice, **consider which Statuses apply to the current situation** and how they might aid or hinder what you are attempting to do. 
- The highest Status working in your favour adds its Tier to your Power.
- The highest Status working against you subtracts its Tier from your Power.
- All other Statuses are still narratively present, but not mechanically relevant.

> [!info] The Tier of the Status is what affects the Power of the dice rolls, and not the amount of Dots.
## GM advice
### Endure moves vs length of the status
Allow characters to [[Endure]] against Statuses if they would be carrying the status around (like wounds).

Don't allow PCs to [[Endure]] against temporary Statuses:
- Likely relevant for a short period of time anyway.
- Even if they have relevant [[Themes]] to resist, they could also be invoked to improve an action.

Getting rid of the temporary Status might also be comparatively easy for shorter statuses. Consider:
- Requiring a successful [[Risk]] (a mechanically simple move).
- As opposed to a [[Change]] (which is mechanically more complex and time-consuming).
### Scene VS PC status
- Giving Statuses to players technically requirse a Hard Move.
- Environmental conditions can also be a Status (not just [[Story Tags]]).
- Specific moves might also be affected by statuses. In this case, be sure to telegraph the extra complication.

>A move affected by the status: A lock the thief is trying to crack issecure-T2. The thief character would see just how high quality that lock is, and thus have the opportunity to back out.
