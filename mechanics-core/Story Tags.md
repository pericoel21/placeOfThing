## Establishing Story Tags
When the GM sets a scene, all the relevant facts are implied to be Story Tags.
Story tags are permanent by default, and can only be invoked once.

> [!tip] Narrative meaning of non-permanent tags
> A story tag is not permanent by default.
> This may mean that the thing it represents is no longer in the scene or it s narratively weak.

> [!example]
>  A Skeleton Archer disintegrates after performing one job, or itâ€™s still around, fighting, but it will not turn the tide of battle.
### Creating story tags
Players can create their own Story Tags with the [[Change]] Move or add more Story Tags on top of created ones.
> [!example]
>  A necromancer PC might make the Skeleton Archer banishment-proof (T3).

It is also possible to add a [[Status]] to any Story tag.
> [!example]
>  The necromancer PC revives a corpse as a Skeleton Archer, essentially creating a new NPC that is a Story Tag.
### Making a story tag permanent
A permanent story tag can be invoked any number of times.
- A Story tag might be permanent by GM fiat.
- The [[Change]] move also has options to make a Story Tag permanent.
## Effect on the roll
- Any number of relevant Story Tags can apply to a given roll.
- Each Story Tag modifies the Power by 1.
## Difference betwen [[Status]] & Story Tag
Story Tags represent aspects of a thing that do not make much sense on a sliding scale, or where tracking a Dot bar would add very little while being annoying to manage.
> [!example]
> There is a difference between a gentle drizzle (raining T1) and a tropical monsoon downpour (raining T5), but for most scenes these are better represented as Story Tags named Gentle Drizzle or Tropical Monsoon Downpour.
