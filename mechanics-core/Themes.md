## The Theme
> [!important] The Theme in a nutshell:
> A theme is a **major idea about a Player Character.** it is a **defining** component of who they are and **fundamental to their life.**
> 
> The Theme is a **container for Power Tags.** Every Power Tag within a Theme **speaks about the theme itself from different angles.**
### Theme creation process
- A player character has **three Themes after [[Character Creation]].**
- Using the [[Make Some Progress|Make Some Progress move]] a character might get a **fourth theme.**
- It is also possible to loose themes and acquire new ones along a campaign.

In any case, the process of creating a Theme is as follows:
1. Select a Theme Sheet.
2. Answer **three questions.**
   The **answers** to this questions are the **Theme's [[Power & Weakness Tags]].**
	1. **The first question answered must be the A option** and it doubles as the name of the Theme.
	2. Pick **any other two questions** to answer.
	3. Any of the selected Tags can be a **Broad Tag** (very **versatile** and **vague** tag).
3. Answer **one Weakness Tag question.** This is the **Theme's Weakness Tag.**
4. Determine the **Aspect** of the Theme by creating a **Goal, Identity or Mystery.**
5. **One** of your Themes can have an **additional Power Tag** if it also has an **additional Weakness Tag.**
### Theme Flavor
There are 3 Flavors: **Physical, Mental** and **Social.** 

Flavors are a useful shorthand to see at a glance what kind of character is the PC, but are only mechanically relevant when using the [[Push Beyond Your Limits|Push Beyond Your Limits Move]] and with certain special abilities or [[Hazards]].

When selecting a Theme Sheet, the specified flavor is the one that better fits that sheet *a priori,* but can be changed.
> [!example]
> *Aggression* being **Physical** makes sense for all the obvious applications, but if you are trying to have mind-rending psychic powers just change the Flavour to **Mental.**

### Aspects
A Goal is something you work towards achieving. This must be something concrete,
and though it can be ambitious, it should not be impossible to achieve.
Examples of Goals are “Obtain the Moth King statuette,” “Bring Inman to justice,” or “Restore the town’s water
supply.”
An Identity is a deeply held belief about yourself that, if it turned out not to be true,
would cause you serious distress. Examples of Identities are “I cannot be bribed,” “Those
kids need me,” or “No one plays better than me.”
A Mystery is a great big question you are seeking answers to. This might be
something very hidden, but it must be theoretically knowable. Examples of Mysteries are
“How does the lich shroud her phylactery?” “Where is my little brother Marco?” or “Who
made those payments to the judge?”
In play, your GM will try to play these different Aspects against each other, be it within
the party or within yourself. This will lead to difficult choices, like when you finally have Inman
in your custody, but he offers that, if you let him go, he will give you some crucial information
on how to find Marco. Or maybe the bribe you are offered ends up being that elusive Moth
King statuette.
