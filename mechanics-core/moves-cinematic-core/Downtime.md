---
Whenever your character has some downtime, choose one way to spend it:
- **Get ready for action:** Explain what you do to prepare and gain up to 4 Tags for your [[Loadout]]. You may replace old ones if you wish.
- **Look into something:** Explain what you do and gain 3 Questions.
- **Pay Attention to a Theme:** Explain what you do and mark one [[Attention]] on that [[Theme]].
- **Take a breather.** Either:
	- Recover all your burned [[Themes]].
	- Take stock of all [[Statuses]] affecting you. The GM will tell you if and how it can be reduced during your downtime, and by how many tiers.

> [!tip] Doing multiple things
> The options above are also not the only things you can do during a single interval of Downtime, just the things you can do with no strings attached.
> 
> You could pick “Get ready for action” and then still do research into a subject matter if you are willing to take the risks of doing a Know Move (and if the GM says there is enough time to do so).
## Duration of downtime
The length of Downtime can vary from a few hours rest to months or even years. Unless the GM sees a good reason for it, you still can only choose one of these effects. However, the more time you have, the more you can heal and the more you can prepare. 
> [!example]
> Checking your travel collection of Grimoires for a specific spell around a dying campfire is just not the same as having enough time to travel to the Great Library of Magic and doing some serious research there.
