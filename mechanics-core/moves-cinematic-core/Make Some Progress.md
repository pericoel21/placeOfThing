When you reach a significant milestone toward achieving your [[Goal]], sacrifice something to abide by your [[Identity]], or find important answers to your [[Mystery]], mark [[Attention]] on that [[Theme]].

When you do something that will make it more difficult to achieve your [[Goal]], act against your [[Identity,]] or forgo answers to your [[Mystery,]] mark a [[Crack]] on that [[Theme]].

When you achieve your [[Goal]], are moved to action by your [[Identity]] or solve your [[Mystery]], you may choose a new [[Goal]], [[Identity]] or [[Mystery]] for that [[Theme]].



You can expand your Themes by gaining Attention. You gain one Attention every time
you invoke that Theme’s Weakness Tag, which results in taking -1 Power for that roll, or some
other complicating consequence. Once you have accrued three Attention, you get to choose a
new Power Tag or unlock a Theme Improvement. Each Theme can only have one Theme
Improvement, so choose wisely. Then, remove the three Attention and begin anew.
​
You may also choose to reset your Crack track back down to zero. Unless you have a
special Theme Improvement, this is the only way you can get rid of Crack on a Theme.
​
Invoking your Weakness Tags is your own responsibility. You do, after all, improve
your character mechanically by doing so. It is always your decision whether your Weakness
Tag applies in a given situation. However, your GM may compel you to invoke your Weakness
Tag. If you choose not to, you must mark Crack on that Theme.
​
When you have marked a total of three Crack on a Theme and you are forced to mark
Crack again, you immediately lose that Theme. This marks a significant change in yourCharacter’s life and self-concept, and should be played out as such narratively. Mechanically,
mark EXP as explained in the Levelling Up section.
Now, or at a later point, choose a new Theme that represents some new part of the
character that is now becoming relevant, ideally of a different Flavour. Fill out only the first
question and one Weakness Tag question from the Theme Sheet. It is now a Budding Theme.
Once you have gained three Attention on that Theme you do not get the usual choice of a
new Power Tag or a Theme Improvement, but always add two Power Tags instead.
This, not linear progression, is how characters actually grow in works of fiction. Think
of when Jaime Lannister has his right hand cut off. Mechanically, this would have been
represented through him losing a Skill Theme describing his swordsmanship. Due to losing
such a key part of his identity, he learns to be a wise leadership figure. This may be
represented through a Budding Conviction, Event, or Personality Theme.
It doesn’t always need to be this dramatic. Every bit of Crack should have a narrative
impact on the story, so often when you lose a Theme it just fades out of your life, and it’s
been a long time coming. You may even narratively retain what that Theme represented, but
no longer derive a mechanical benefit from it, as it is not such an important part of who you
are any more. For example, when you lose your Profession Theme, you may be getting fired
from your job at the archaeology department, or maybe you just lose all passion for it and
treat cataloguing old pottery as the mind-bogglingly boring day job it actually is.
