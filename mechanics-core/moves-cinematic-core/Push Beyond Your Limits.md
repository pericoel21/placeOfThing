When you attempt an absolutely incredible feat, tell the GM what you are trying to achieve. They will tell you what it will cost.

> [!tip] Using this cinematic Move
> The thing you are trying to attempt should be beyond the current capabilities of your character, but thematically within the realm of what they can do. A druid may be able to channel all their life essence into revitalizing an entire dead forest, but won’t gain a warrior’s ability to establish a beachhead alone against an overwhelming force, and vice versa.

Roll + [[Flavour]], depending on which Theme Flavour this feat most heavily depends on.
## Outcome
On a hit, you do it, and pay the price:

### Failure
On a 6 or less, you pay the price given for 7-9, but you also fail and/or the situation runs out of hand. The GM will decide what happens and what the consequences are.
