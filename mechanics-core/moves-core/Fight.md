## Combat options

- Manage to **achieve the goal** you were competing over or they were blocking you from.
- **Avoid a counterattack** or collateral damage.
- **Aggro,** keep the target focused on you.
- **Gain the advantage,** gaining **2 [[Change|Shift]].**
- **Impose a Status** equal to your Power, though always at least 1 (this option may only be chosen once).
- Hit them especially hard, increasing the Tier of the Status by 1 (if you also chose the previous option).
### Imposing a status
When imposing a Status with the fight move:
- The **Tier is equal to Power** for a new status.
- If the target already has the same status:
	- The **Tier obtained is greater** than the current one: the Status **increases to that greater Tier.**
	- The **Tier obtained is equal** to the current one: the Status **increases one Tier.**
	- The **Tier obtained is smaller** than the current one: **add a number of Dots equal to Power** to the tracker.
