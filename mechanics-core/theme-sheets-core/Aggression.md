abstract: Theme Sheet for Aggression.
---
> This Theme is all about doing damage. It’s pretty straightforward in its pursuit of destruction, and it can do little else. The mode of aggression does not have to be physical, but can include an ability to harm others socially or emotionally as well. 

> [!example] Examples:
> - Gunslinging
> - Combat magic
> - Scathing tongue
> - Killer martial arts

## Theme Upgrades
#### Unstoppable Force
 When you FIGHT with tags from this theme, on a 12+, that Move becomes Critical.
#### Warrior Code
 Answer a question from the Conviction theme sheet and add it as a Power Tag to this theme. It does not count against your 6 tag limit.
#### Shock and Awe
 When using Power Tags from this theme, if your enemy was unaware of you or your coming attack (up to the GM), a result of 6 or less counts as a 7-9.
#### Punching Down
 Once per session, you may give someone a damaging tier 2 status related to this Theme without having to roll.
#### Perfect Technique
 Choose one Power Tag on this Theme (it cannot be Power Tag A). Once per scene, when you score a 7 to 9 on a roll where you invoked this Tag, it becomes a 10.
