> This Theme represents an almost uncanny degree of proficiency in navigating specific subcultures and scenes. It’s normal to be best acquainted with the jargon and traditions of one’s social surroundings, but it’s a big deal to be able to play them like an instrument. 

> [!example] Examples:
> - Scene queen
> - Military veterans
> - Organised crime
> - Superhero network

## Theme Upgrades
#### Save Face
 When you would mark Crack on this theme, you may burn two of its Power Tags instead.
#### Do You Know Who I am
 Answer a question from the Standing theme sheet and add it as a Power Tag to this theme. It does not count against your 6 tag limit.
#### Social Chameleon
 Once per Scene, when you use Tags from this Theme to avoid negative consequences in a subculture not covered by your Etiquette, you may transform a result of 6 or less into a result of 7-9.
#### The Fixer
 Once per Session, when you are trying to get people from your circles to make something happen behind the scenes, take connected-2 for the duration of organising that process.
#### Call In A Favour
 Gain an additional Power Tag slot on this Theme. The Tag in this Slot functions like a Loadout Tag, but it can only be filled with things that fit the Theme. It is automatically refilled every Downtime.
