## Theme Upgrades
#### Beyond Specifications
 When you would burn a tag for a hit on this theme, you may mark Crack instead. If you do, it counts as a Box Cars success.
#### Built-In
 Answer a question from the Attribute theme sheet and add it as a Power Tag to this theme.
#### Guns Blazing
 When you use tags from this theme with tags from another theme, that Move becomes Critical.
#### Made In Germany
 Once per Session, when you burn a tag from this Theme (either for a hit or as a Hard Move by the GM), you may keep the tag unburned while still benefiting from the effects of burning it.
#### Swiss Army Knife
 Gain an additional Power Tag slot on this Theme. The Tag in this Slot functions like a Loadout Tag, but it can only be filled with things that fit the Theme. It is automatically refilled every Downtime.
