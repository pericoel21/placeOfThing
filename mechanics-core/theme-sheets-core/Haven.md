> For some, home is just a place to sleep. For you, it’s a major part of your life, your base of operations, your pride and joy. This can be a lot of different things, so long as it does not include the words Live Laugh Love as decoration. Seriously, you can’t use this Theme if that’s the case.

#### Fort Knox
 While you or your allies are inside of your Haven, you have safe-B2.
#### Showcase Garage
 Answer a question from the Movement theme sheet and add it as a Power Tag to this theme. It does not count against your 6 tag limit.
#### Real Rembrandt
 Describe an item of great value located within your haven. Once per Session, in a situation where owning this item would be relevant, you may give yourself a temporary status of 2.
