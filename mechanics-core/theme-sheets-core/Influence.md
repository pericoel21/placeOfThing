> This Theme represents your ability to make other people do what you want. This may be straightforward charisma or telepathy, but also incentive structures that will make people more likely to do as you tell them (or simply as you wish without having to spell it out). 

> [!example] Examples:
> - Animal magnetism
> - Mind control
> - Pheromone implants
> - Political power

## Theme Upgrades
#### Thrall Master
 When you try to give Status or Story Tag on a character you have given a Status or Story Tag to in the past, treat a result of 6 or less as a 7-9.
#### The Song of My People
 Answer a question from the Etiquette theme sheet and add it as a Power Tag to this theme. It does not count against your 6 tag limit.
#### I Can Explain
 Once per session, when you invoke a Weakness Tag from this Theme, you may choose not to be disadvantaged, but still gain a point of Attention.
#### Adorkable
 When you invoke one of your Weakness Tags from this Theme, on a 12+, that Move becomes Critical.
#### Kafka Trap
 When you CHANGE and roll 6 or less using Tags from this Theme, you gain the benefits of a 7-9, but the GM still gets a hard move.
