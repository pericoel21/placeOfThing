## Theme Upgrades
#### Tough Minions
 When you use Tags from this Theme to CHANGE and create entities in the story, you may give them a Story Tag describing some form of resistance for free.
#### Rowdy Bunch
 When using Tags from this theme to CHANGE, on a 10 or higher, you can choose to gain one additional point of Shift, but the GM gets to make a Soft Move against you as your powers spin a little out of control.
#### The General
 Answer a question from the Aggression theme sheet and add it as a Power Tag to this theme. It does not count against your 6 tag limit.
#### Top Shelf
 Choose one Power Tag on this Theme (it cannot be Power Tag A). Once per scene, when you score a 7 to 9 on a roll where you invoked this Tag, it becomes a 10.
#### Combined Arms
 When you use tags from this theme with tags from another theme, on a 12+, that Move becomes Critical.
