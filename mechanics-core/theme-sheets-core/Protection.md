abstract: Theme Sheet for Protection.
---
> This Theme may be about protecting others, yourself, or both, but itâ€™s fundamentally about any and all kinds of harm reduction. Physical damage is far from the only thing a character can suffer, and tanking it is only one of the options to avoid being harmed. 

> [!example] Examples:
> - Heavy armour
> - Shield projectors
> - Legal defence
> - Death ward
