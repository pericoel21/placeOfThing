> Few people have no Skills. This Theme is about very specific Skills though, the kind that you identify with as a person. Other people see a challenge and immediately think you are the right one for the job, because it’s not just something you can do, but a passion. 

> [!example] Examples:
> - Survival expert
> - Ace pilot
> - Medical training
> - Elite hacker

## Theme Upgrades
#### Tools of the Trade
 Answer a question from the Gear theme sheet and add it as a Power Tag to this theme. It does not count against your 6 tag limit.
#### Reliable Talent
 Once per scene, when you roll 6 or less using Tags from this Theme, gain the benefits of a 7-9. The GM still gets a hard move.
#### Magnum Opus
 Once per Session, when you burn a Power Tag from this Theme for a hit, it automatically counts as a Box Cars Success.
#### Hot Off The Presses
 Gain an additional Power Tag slot on this Theme. The Tag in this Slot functions like a Loadout Tag, but it can only be filled with things that fit the Theme. It is automatically refilled every Downtime.
#### Vital Flaw
 When you invoke one of your Weakness Tags from this Theme, on a 12+, that Move becomes Critical.
