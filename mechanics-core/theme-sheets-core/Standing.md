> Some think of power as a privilege, others see it as a burden, but there’s no doubt it allows you to do things most people cannot. Others see something in you, an ephemeral quality they respect, if by nothing else then by social convention, and because everybody else does. 

> [!example] Examples:
> - Noble title
> - Police rank
> - University tenure
> - County treasurer
